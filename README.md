# ISO - IRIS Spiglet Optimizer

This is an educational purpose framework for spiglet IR optimization. 
It utilizes the IRIS reasoner to perform static analysis on the spiglet source code and then makes the necessary transformations to apply those optimizations to spiglet code. 
The project's purpose is to be used for Compilers university courses as a basic tool for dataflow analysis projects using Datalog.
